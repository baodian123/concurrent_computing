# logic

For everyone who arrive the river side, he/she will
watch if there is a safe composition of boat load,
and if boat is ready, if there is, the composition
will be take on board, and if there is not, he/she
will wait at the river side, until someone sees a
safe composition of boat load, or the boat is ready
at river side and sees there is a safe composition,
boat will also take them on board.

# work

Either passenger or boat will check if there is a
safe composition of boat load, so that there is
always someone check that if there is a safe composition
of boat load, hence the boat can run continuously.

# variable meaning

lock_stdout: lock the standard out
m_count: the number of missionary (should be 0 in initial)
c_count: the number of cannibal (should be 0 in initial)
Condition c: let cannibal wait at river side
Condition m: let missionary wait at river side
Condition left: passenger left the boat
Condition boat_start: boat left river side and start to row
load: record the passenger id
type: record the passenger type
seat: the remaining seat of boat (should be 0 in initial)
round: the number of boat load round (should be 1 in initial)
is_boat_ready: whether the boat is ready for the next round or not
tid(cannibal, missionary): their identical number

# boat load

If there is a safe composition of boat load, who sees this
composition will signal the condition variable boat_start
to tell boat start, and boat will see the composition and
let the passenger of this composition get on boat by signal
the condition variable c or m exactly three times.

# policy

For cannibal who arrives the river side:
Seeing that there are two missionaris or two cannibals
will form a safe composition of boat load.

For missionary who arrives the river side:
Seeing that there are two missionaris or one missionary
and one cannibal will form a safe composition of boat load.

# Question 1

Before crossing complete, all passenger will wait the
condition variable: left, until boat done, boat will
signal condition variable: left to let the passenger
get off the boat.

# Question 2

Same as question 1, use the condition variable: left
to guarantee that no one can jump off the boat while
the boat is crossing the river.

# Question 3

After the composition is decided, boat will let the
passenger of this composition get on the boat, by
this time, passenger will regist their type and id
to record who is get on the boat, cannibal and
missionary who doesn't pick by boat will be lock
at the river side by condition variable: c or m.

# Question 4

Passenger who is on river crossing will wait until
the boat done and tell them they can leave by using
condition variable: left, after this, passenger still
can arrive at river side again.
