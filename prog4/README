# logic

At beginning, first eagle will wake mom to prepare food,
and then wait for food ready, the second eagle will stay
until first eagle take the food.

For second and later round, if there is eagle find food
is empty, it will wait until no eagle is eating and then
wake up mother eagle, and after this, all eagle which want
to eat food will wait for food ready also wait first eagle
take the food, for later round, repeat this routine until
mother eagle retire.

# work

Use sufficient semophore, and one counter for food,
especially prepare a semophore to protect the food counter,
and another protect baby eagle which is taking the food.

# Question 1

At any time, if counter is equal to 0 means there is no food,
the first eagle which see the food is empty will lock the
semophore (waiting_eagle_can_eat_mutex), and wake up mother
eagle to prepare food, no more than m baby eagles can eating
due to the food counter would not be negative.

# Question 2

If baby eagle want to eat, it will first see if there is any
feeding pot is filled, if there is not(or maybe all pot is
take by others eagle), it will wait until all eagle finish
the food and wake up mom eagle. Using pot_count_mutex can
know the current free pot number, and no_eagle_eating_mutex
is used to wait no eagle is eating, finally, use wake_mutex
(Signal) to wake up mom, and use food_ready_mutex wait food
prepared.

# Question 3

Using pot_count_mutex can know the current free pot number,
if there is more than 0, take out the pot and minus the
count 1, finally unlock the pot_count_mutex, at any time,
no more than one eagle can manipulate the pot number, since
pot_count_mutex is initialized to 1.

# Question 4

If there is a baby eagle want to eat food, it will first
lock the pot_count_mutex and see if there is any pot filled
(using pot_count <- protected by pot_count_mutex), if there
is no filled pot, it will wait no eagle eating and wake up
mother eagle.

# Question 5

If a baby eagle find a filled feeding pot, it will take out
the feeding pot (pot_count--), there is no more than one
baby eagle can do this, since pot_count is protected by the
pot_count_mutex. There is no more than one baby eagle can
take out same feeding pot.

# Question 6

If a baby eagle find all feeding pot is empty, it will wake
up mother eagle, no else baby eagle can do this since the
first eagle will lock waiting_eagle_can_eat_mutex until food
prepared and taked the food.

# Question 7

Mother eagle will take a nap, and use wake_mutex to wait
any baby eagle wake her up.

# Question 8

Mother eagle only can be waked while she is taking a nap
(wake_mutex).

# Question 9

Before feeding pots are all filled, baby eagle which want
to eat will wait the first eagle which see the feeding pot
is empty and wake mother up, first eagle will wait mother
eagle prepare food use food_ready_mutex, mother eagle will
inform the first eagle can eat after all feeding pots is
filled.

# Question 10

After feeding pots are all filled, mom eagle will Signal the
food_ready_mutex to let the baby eagle which wake her up can
eat, then all baby eagle can eat since the first eagle has
taken the food and release the waiting_eagle_can_eat_mutex.

# Question 11

At the final round, let mom eagle take a nap until all baby
eagle finish the food and wake her up, after this, mom eagle
can retire and there will no baby eagle is eating.
